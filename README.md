# Final course project: Security strategy

## Introduction
This exercise provides an opportunity to apply your theoretical knowledge in a practical, real-world scenario. By completing this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in conducting a security analysis, identifying potential threats, assessing their risks, and formulating effective countermeasures.

## Scenario
Sam’s Scoops has experienced substantial expansion. Operating across multiple locations, Sam’s Scoops deals with sensitive customer data, including credit card information, addresses, and personal details.

The growing workforce, now over 250 employees, work in diverse departments. An emerging concern is that some of these employees bring their personal computers to the office, potentially introducing new vulnerabilities into the company's network.

Given the rising complexity of cyber threats, Sam’s Scoops is increasingly exposed to potential risks like phishing, ransomware, and DDoS attacks. Furthermore, data breaches are an ever-looming threat that could impact the company's reputation and financial stability.

## Objective
Your task is to conduct a comprehensive security analysis and develop a detailed security strategy report for Sam’s Scoops. The strategy should address the evolving threats that the company could encounter and outline suitable solutions for risk mitigation and data protection.
